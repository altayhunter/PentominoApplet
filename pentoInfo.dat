   PENTOMINO

   The objective of this puzzle is to place all pentominoes on the board after you have
   marked four squares to remain empty. To clear the board you push the button that
   says "begin". A grid will appear. In the grid click on four different squares. They
   will turn black. Then click on the pentomino of your choice, hold the mousebutton
   and drag it on the board. To remove a pentomino you can drag it over the edge -
   any edge - of the board and release it. Push (or hold) the right mousebutton to
   rotate; doubleclick to flip the pentomino.
